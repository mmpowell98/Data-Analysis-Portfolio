# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

## About

My name is Morgan Powell and I work as a data analyst for a health system. I have an MPH with a focus on Epidemiology and Biostatistics and routinely work on surveillance and evaluation efforts to understand health trends in the communities I work in. 

My first professional role involved wastewater-based epidemiology, which ignited my passion for the field of epidemiology and led me to pursue an MPH at Boston University. Between fullt-time work, school and an internship with a local health system in Cambridge, MA, I explored various data tools and became familiar with concepts. Now, I regularly work in Excel, SAS, R Studio and am gaining familiarity for SQL. I have also used PowerBI and QGIS in the past, though do not regularly incorporate it into my daily functions. 

I enjoy working with complex data and looking for trands within while also implementing quality control efforts. I am eager to learn as many skills as I can to support my journey as a data analyst in the public health space. 

I have created this repository to showcase the data analysis skills I have gained through my professional and academic experiences.

## Portfolio

In this section I will list some personal and academic data analytic projects I worked on, with brief descriptions of the processes taken. 

### Covid Health Disparities among Male and Female in Europe and other Regions
  **Code**: [Covid Health Disparities among Male and Female in Europe and other Regions](https://github.com/mmpowell98/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/GH854%20Final%20Project.xlsx)

  **Goal**: To create a dashboard of sex-related Covid-19 statistics among countries with data.

  **Description**: This project involved a publicly-avaliable dataset of Covid-19 statistics at the country level. While not all countries had sex-disaggregated data, I focused on only countries that did to further understand the ratio of cases among males and females. I also added in a column based on the region of that country to be able to further explore regional differences.

  **Skills**: Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation, Pivot Tables, Data Visualization

  **Tool**: Excel

  **Result**: On the sheet titled 'Presentation' there is a dashboard with some of the key findings from the dataset. Slicers, Pivot Tables and multiple graphs are incorporated to convey the findings. 

### Assessing Percent Uninsured in Maine Compared with US and New England
 **Code**: [Assessing Percent Uninsured in Maine Compared with US and New England](https://github.com/mmpowell98/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/County_Health_Rankings_ME.R)

  **Goal**: To assess the percent of Maine's population that is uninsured and compare it with New England and National data. 

  **Description**: This project involved various datasets regarding insurance. County-level data was downloaded from the County Health Rankings to understand trends within Maine. Longitudinal data was downloaded from the Census Bureau's Health Insurance Historical Tables to compare Maine to the US. New England regional data was downloaded from KFF's estimates based on the American Community Survey 2023 1-year estimate. 

  **Skills**: Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation, Data Visualization, Heat Map

  **Tool**: R

  **Result**: Multiple visualizations that summarize the status of Maine's population that is uninsured, both within the state but also compared to New england and nationally.
