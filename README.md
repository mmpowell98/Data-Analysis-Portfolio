# Data-Analysis-Portfolio

## About

My name is Morgan Powell and I work as a data analyst for a health system. I have an MPH with a focus on Epidemiology and Biostatistics and routinely work on surveillance and evaluation efforts to understand health trends in the communities I work in. 

My first professional role involved wastewater-based epidemiology, which ignited my passion for the field of epidemiology and led me to pursue an MPH at Boston University. Between fullt-time work, school and an internship with a local health system in Cambridge, MA, I explored various data tools and became familiar with concepts. Now, I regularly work in Excel, SAS, R Studio and am gaining familiarity for SQL. I have also used PowerBI and QGIS in the past, though do not regularly incorporate it into my daily functions. 

I enjoy working with complex data and looking for trands within while also implementing quality control efforts. I am eager to learn as many skills as I can to support my journey as a data analyst in the public health space. 

I have created this repository to showcase the data analysis skills I have gained through my professional and academic experiences.

## Portfolio

In this section I will list some personal and academic data analytic projects I worked on, with brief descriptions of the processes taken. 

### Covid Health Disparities among Male and Female in Europe and other Regions
  **Code**: (GH854 Final Project.xlsx)

  **Goal**: To create a dashboard of sex-related Covid-19 statistics among countries with data.

  **Description**: This project involved a publicly-avaliable dataset of Covid-19 statistics at the country level. While not all countries had sex-disaggregated data, I focused on only countries that did to further understand the ratio of cases among males and females. I also added in a column based on the region of that country to be able to further explore regional differences.

  **Skills**: Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation, Pivot Tables, Data Visualization

  **Tool**: Excel

  **Result**: On the sheet titled 'Presentation' there is a dashboard with some of the key findings from the dataset. Slicers, Pivot Tables and multiple graphs are incorporated to convey the findings.
